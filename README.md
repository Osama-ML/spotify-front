HTML &amp; CSS project 

### About the project

- It is a personal project to improve and test my skills of layout and analysis of elements of a web page with the devtools.

- The project is focused on maintaining a solid structure in the HTML with a good naming of classes for the CSS.

- Modularization and having a file structure is not the priority of this project, that's why everything is contained in an HTML and CSS file

### More information

- To carry out the design I have used both Grid and Flexbox.
- I have not used any type of animation os JS.
- Most svg are the official Spotify ones.
- It is not responsive.
